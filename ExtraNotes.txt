What is CLI?

CLI stands for Command-Line Interface.

It is a way to interact with software using text commands typed into a terminal or command prompt.

Unlike a Graphical User Interface (GUI), there are no buttons or visual menus ‚Äî everything is typed.

Examples:

Terminal on Mac/Linux

Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows

You type commands like:

cd my-project
ls
mkdir newFolder

üîπ What are CLI Tools?

CLI tools are programs or utilities that you run from the command line to perform tasks.

They help developers do things faster without opening GUIs.

Often used for project setup, build, deployment, testing, and automation.

Examples in React/JS ecosystem:

Node.js CLI ‚Üí node app.js runs JavaScript programs.

npm CLI ‚Üí npm install react installs packages.

Create React App CLI ‚Üí npx create-react-app my-app sets up a new React project.

Git CLI ‚Üí git commit -m "message" manages version control.

Vite CLI ‚Üí npm create vite@latest my-app quickly scaffolds modern React apps.
