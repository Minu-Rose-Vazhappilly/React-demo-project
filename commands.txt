How to Deploy a site
--------------------------
change the json-server ---{version without alpha or beta}----in this version we can't run json file using "npx json-server db.json"
create  a .gitignore file in server folder 
create a javascript file named index.js in serverfolder
type those code in index.js
run index.js

create a GitHub repository and push all codes of server into GitHub

to deploy render.com is used
link render.com with GitHub->click new=>click project->select the appropriate GitHub repository from projects and link it 
change test:"bfjbj" into start:"node index.js"
go to render render.com -> refresh site-> deploy it

get the new url of backend end from render(click the image ,it will open a new window with server project)
copy the url and change the baseurl of frontend project as this(change it from services folder->baseUrl.js->Change BASEURL)
push them in git hub

to deploy front end vercel is used(vercel dynamic deployment,it creates build by their own)
same as render
link it with GitHub
click add new project->link it github->select appropriate GitHub repository and import it -> deploy project
